# ðŸ› Algorithmic Toolbox
To learn and practice fundamental algorithms, I enrolled in a class on coursera called [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox).
I learned many essential algorithm design method like __divide-and-conquer__, __greedy algorithm__, and __dynamic programming__.
I chose to write all the assignments with c++ to become more familiar with this programming language.

&nbsp;

## The main goals of this course includes:

- Practice implementing algorithms
- Practice testing and stress testing programs
- Compare fast and slow programs
- Practice solving programming challenges
